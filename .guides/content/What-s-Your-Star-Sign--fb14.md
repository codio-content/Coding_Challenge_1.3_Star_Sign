You probably know your own star sign but for this challenge your program will need to output the star sign for any date in the year.

## Task
Write a program called `challenge3.py` that will do the following:

 - Accept day and month integers as input
 - Output a corresponding star sign
 
Here's a star sign table to help you:

| Date Range                      | Star Sign   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| March 21st     - April 19th     | Aries       |
| April 20th     - May 20th       | Taurus      |
| May 21st       - June 20th      | Gemini      |
| June 21st      - July 22nd      | Cancer      |
| July 23rd      - August 22nd    | Leo         |
| August 23rd    - September 22nd | Virgo       |
| September 23rd - October 22nd   | Libra       |
| October 23rd   - November 21st  | Scorpio     |
| November 22nd  - December 21st  | Sagittarius |
| December 22nd  - January 19th   | Capricorn   |
| January 20th   - February 18th  | Aquarius    |
| February 19th  - March 20th     | Pisces      |

### Test Data
It's always a good idea to test your solution using test data. Use the following test data to check your program:

| Test Data          | Exp. Output     |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Day: 3,  Month: 3  | Pisces          |
| Day: 23, Month: 8  | Virgo           |
| Day: 21, Month: 12 | Sagittarius     |

Now pick a few more dates of your own to use as test data.
